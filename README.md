# Simple stopwatch program

This was made using the Python library Tkinter. The time is extremely accurate. This program also uses tkmacosx. This is because a lot of color features in tkinter won't work in MacOS. So, I decicded to use tkmacosx to see the colors. You will see the same colors on Windows.
